# Task JS Application

Task.js is a simple, lightweight JavaScript project aimed at managing tasks efficiently using the browser's local storage. The project provides a streamlined user experience by allowing users to add, delete, and search for tasks, with all data persistently stored on the client's side. Here are the key features:

1. **Task Addition**: Users can effortlessly add new tasks to the list, which are immediately saved to local storage for persistent data management.

2. **Task Filtering/Search**: Implement a dynamic search feature that allows users to quickly filter and identify specific tasks from the list. This feature improves usability by ensuring that users can efficiently manage and locate their tasks.

3. **Task Deletion**: Offers users the flexibility to delete individual tasks, with each deletion synchronized with local storage, ensuring everything remains up-to-date.

4. **Clear All Tasks**: For a quick reset, users can clear all tasks with a single action, purging the local storage and starting fresh.

5. **Local Storage Integration**: All tasks are saved to and loaded from the browser's local storage, meaning the user's task list is preserved even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.

6. **DOM Manipulation with Vanilla JavaScript**: The project exclusively utilizes vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation, providing users with a smooth and responsive experience while interacting with the task list.

These features make Task.js a robust yet simple task management application that emphasizes speed, reliability, and ease of use.
